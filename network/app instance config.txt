**************************************|  App Instance config  |********************************************

1.	Start by installing NVM (node version manager).

sudo su ubuntu
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

2.	install a compatible version of Node.js and make sure it's being used:

nvm install 16
nvm use 16

3.	PM2 is a daemon process manager that will keep our node.js app running when we exit the instance or 
	if it is rebooted. Install that as well.

npm install -g pm2   

4.	Now we need to download our code from our s3 buckets onto our instance. You must have uploaded to
	s3 before. You may be asked to install and configure aws cli before running aws s3 cp

cd ~/
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/app-tier/ app-tier --recursive

5.	Navigate to the app directory, install dependencies, and start the app with pm2.

cd ~/app-tier
npm install
pm2 start index.js

6.	To make sure the app is running correctly run the following:

pm2 list

7.	If you see a status of online, the app is running. If you see errored, then you need to do some 
	troubleshooting. To look at the latest errors, use this command:

pm2 logs

8.	Right now, pm2 is just making sure our app stays running when we leave the SSM session. However, 
	if the server is interrupted for some reason, we still want the app to start and keep running. This is 
	also important for the AMI we will create:
	
pm2 startup

	Copy and paste the command provided by running pm2 startup. Then
	save the current list of node processes with the following command:

pm2 save
